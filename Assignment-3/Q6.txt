Advantages of using OO:
1. The basic structure of the code remains the same even after making changes. All the functions remain inside the class and are easy to update.
2. The OO method has a faster execution time for the grading operation.

Advantages of using Dictionaries:
1. Dictionaries are easier to implement compared to OO. We can easily see all the data by just printing the dictionary.
2. The dictionary method has a faster execution time for the searching operation.

Disadvantages of using OO:
1. The length of the program using OO is larger as compared to dictionary.
2. OO is not easy to learn and takes time to get used to. Dictionaries have an easier syntax as compared to OO.

Disadvantages of using dictionaries:
1. Dictionaries are unordered and the value for a given key may not follow the same structure as others.
2. We can easily encounter key errors hence we need to handle more special cases in dictionaries as compared to OO.

Performance comparison for grading operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much):
1. N: 2500
2. Time by OO: 0.0119 seconds (ran the program 10 times and took the average)
3. Time by dictionary: 0.03142 seconds (ran the program 10 times and took the average)
4. X is faster; fraction of time X took is: OO is faster; fraction of time OO took is 0.378

Performance comparison for search operation (give in each line: value of N; time taken by two approaches in seconds, and which is faster and by how much):
1. N: 1
2. Time by OO: 0.0026 seconds (ran the program 10 times and took the average)
3. Time by dictionary: 0.0021 seconds (ran the program 10 times and took the average)
4. X is faster; fraction of time X took is: Dictionary is faster; fraction of time dictionary took is 0.807
